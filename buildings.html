            <h2>About Posttension Concrete</h2>
            <p>
              Posttension concrete slabs have become a major factor on the
              construction of floor systems for commercial and residential
              buildings of all types. In their two most popular forms (one way
              slabs, two way flat plates) they have been found to be economical
              for structural applications in parking structures, apartment
              buildings, office buildings, hospitals and industrial buildings of
              both the high rise and low rise type.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons that led to the development of this
              technology is that post-tensioning can solve simultaneously
              weight, deflection and cracking problems, which usually found in
              conventionally reinforced slabs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether for ground slabs or suspended floors, developers and
              construction professionals harness the immense benefits to be
              gained by adopting a post-tensioned solution for their projects.

            <h2>Bonded Posttension</h2>
            <p>
              Bonded Post-Tensioning Slab System consists of fully encapsulated,
              bonded multi-strand (two to five strands) tendons contained in
              flat ducts filled with a high-performance cementitious grout that
              bonds the strands to the surrounding concrete
            </p>
            <p>
              When the tendons have stretched sufficiently, according to the
              design specifications they are wedged in position and maintain
              tension after the jacks are removed, transferring pressure to the
              concrete. The duct is then grouted to protect the tendons from
              corrosion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h2>Un-Bonded Posttension</h2>
            <p>
              Adaptable to a variety of structures, un-bonded mono-strand
              post-tensioning can be easily, rapidly and economically installed.
              Use 0.5” and 0.6” diameter strands coated with a layer of
              specially formulated grease with an outer layer of seamless
              plastic extruded in one continuous operation to provide protection
              against corrosion. Each tendon is precisely coiled, cut, labeled,
              color-coded and delivered to the construction site.
            </p>
            <p>
              A wide variety of anchorage systems are available to meet design
              specifications. Encapsulated un-bonded mono-strand posttensioning
              systems are used in areas that are subject to corrosive
              conditions. Strands are protected at the anchorages using greased
              plastic sleeves and grease-filled end caps.

        <h2>Benefits of Posttension in Buildings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Achievement of complex geometry & special design challenges –
            meeting all the needs of modern architecture
          </li>
          <li>
            Large column-free spaces – spans of up to 15m are common in standard
            PT slabs
          </li>
          <li>
            Shallower slabs – PT slabs are up to 30% shallower, reducing the
            building height or allowing more floors within the original building
            height
          </li>
          <li>
            Less materials– with PT, less concrete and steel is needed for the
            superstructure
          </li>
          <li>
            Program & cost saving – groundwork requirements for a PT structure
            are reduced
          </li>
          <li>
            Faster program - thinner PT slabs and early strength stressing,
            promoting faster floor cycle times
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduced maintenance costs – structures are more durable as use of PT
            promotes better crack and deflection/vibration control
          </li>
